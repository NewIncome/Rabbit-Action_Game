1. Beginning Stage
    - First, green mosters with low life will appear, after defeating them with a punch, starts stage 2
2. Second Stage
    - Pink Monsters will appear, less of them but with more life so you will have to hit them more times
3. Final Stage
    - The Boss will appear. He will be alone but you will need to hit him a lot more times because he is stronger. He will also always run from you after every punch
All the enemies, including the boss, will run al over at different speeds and when they fall of the land tiles they will respawn at the top

You will die and it will be game over if you fall off the tiles and into infinity, so be careful
